Implementing multiple logistic regression and binary logistic regression for the well known mnist dataset 

No other py libraries / functions / external tools was used for the regression models aside the below;
# import numpy as np
# from scipy.io import loadmat
# from scipy.optimize import minimize

also creating the support vector machine(SVM) models with multiple radial basis function with multiple gamma settings 
# from sklearn import svm
# from sklearn.svm import SVC
# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
